# This file contains a list of packages that will be installed in the first
# stage "pre-installation" system.
#
# Adding packages here will not cause them to end up in the final
# installed ZFS system.  That is done by the scripts that make up the
# installer ( in zfs-config/packages.d/_ALWAYS.customise.add/zfs.d/ )

# TODO:
# Would install this key package (also from the contrib repos), but it
# depends on building the zfs kernel modules (which we do not need, since
# ubuntu's kernel includes them).  Additionally, if this could be installed
# then it would pull in the above dependencies automatically
#zfsutils-linux

# ensure we can verify the ubuntu package signatures
